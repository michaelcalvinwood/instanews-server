<p>A sharp cold front will sweep through northeast Colorado this evening. Severe storms will be possible ahead of its arrival.</p><div> <p>DENVER — Severe thunderstorms will be possible in northeast Colorado between 4 and 8 p.m. Thursday. As of 3:30 p.m. on Thursday afternoon, gusty winds were already pushing into far northern Colorado, with winds topping 40 mph in parts of Weld and Larimer Counties.</p> <p>Severe weather is considered to be large hail that's 1 inch in diameter or larger, wind gusts of 58 mph or greater, or tornadoes.</p> <p>NOAA's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/">Storm Prediction Center</a> (SPC) issues a product everyday that's called the Convective Outlook. On 9NEWS, our meteorologists simply call it the Severe Thunderstorm Risk.</p> <p>SPC issued a Marginal Convective Outlook for Thursday afternoon covering the area to the north and northeast of Denver, including Ft. Collins, Greeley, Ft. Morgan, and Sterling.</p> <p>Marginal is a Level 1 threat out of 5 levels. Marginal means only a few isolated storms are expected to become severe. A Level 5 High threat would mean that numerous thunderstorms could become severe and be very widespread across the area.</p> <p>In Colorado, most of our most destructive storms happen on Marginal or Slight Risk days because we tend to get more isolated and scattered thunderstorms, as opposed to large outbreaks.</p> <p>These severe thunderstorm risk forecasts usually get issued at least 24 hours in advance, but for bigger storms systems they can give you a three-day warning or even longer.</p> <p> </p><h2>Colorado cold front</h2> <p></p> <p>Besides the thunderstorm threat that will develop in the earlier part of the afternoon Thursday, there will also be a powerful cold front that will sweep across the area.</p> <p>It's expected to arrive in the Denver area sometime between 5 and 8 p.m. Earlier on Thursday afternoon, the same front dropped temperatures in Casper, Wyoming by 22 degrees in just 30 minutes. It also plunged temperatures by 13 degrees in just 20 minutes.</p> <p>That could produce severe and damaging wind gusts of 58 mph or greater. It will also push up a few storm cells that could produce lightning, small hail, graupel and even some very heavy snowfall.</p> <p><span><em>&gt; Top stories from 9NEWS curated daily just for you! </em></span><em><a href="https://www.9news.com/email" target="_blank"><span>Sign up for the 9NEWSLETTER</span></a><span> right now to get can’t-miss stories, Next and Broncos content, weather and more delivered right to your inbox.</span></em></p> <div> <p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLlV2Iuo79CuppsQv5JDNNi6c1Lf7Of0x4" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></p> </div> </div>
